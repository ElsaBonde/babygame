# Milk Mayhem

## Game description
Deep within the intricate corridors of a labyrinth, a daring infant embarks on a high-stakes mission. The clock is ticking - within a mere 60 seconds, the baby must snatch up as many formula bottles as possible. Each precious formula bottle secured contributes to your escalating score. But tread cautiously, for the devious beer bottles lurk, threatening to impede the baby's progress and points. (Should the baby indulge in more than one beer, it careens into a 360-degree spin - a hazardous state best avoided).

As you navigate the labyrinth's twists and turns, seizing every opportunity, keep an eye out for the elusive clocks. Grabbing one of these time-stopping devices provides a crucial advantage - freezing time, enabling you to amass points while the countdown timer remains suspended in stillness for 5 seconds.

But the ultimate challenge looms: the door to the next level must be reached within the unforgiving 60-second timeframe. Failure means the abrupt conclusion of the game, the echoes of the baby's cries marking the end of your valiant attempt.

Yet, succeed, and a window unveils your triumphant score as the baby erupts in joyous laughter. Now stands the moment of decision - will you boldly venture forth into the next level or restart your perilous journey for an even greater triumph?

Embrace the exhilarating quest, where every second carries the weight of destiny. Can you guide the baby through the labyrinth, reach the door in time, and emerge victorious? The clock is ticking, the bottles beckon, and the labyrinth awaits your daring pursuit. May fortune favor the swift!
